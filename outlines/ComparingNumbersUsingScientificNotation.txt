Learning goal: I can compare two quantities using scientific notation.
Assignment: Choose something very large and something very small, and compare the two sizes using scientific notation. 
Example: How much bigger is a blue whale than a Paedophryne ... frog?
 Metric system
  Scale for measuring lengths
  Units are meters
  Meters abbreviated m
  Numbers of meters are written in SN, using powers of ten
  Exponents tell us how many times we multiply by ten 
  10^0 = 1
  positive exponents are used to represent numbers greater than 1
  Sizes larger than 1 meter
  every step we multiply by another factor of 10
  10^1 = 10, 10^2 = 100
  negative exponents used to represent numbers less than 1
  Sizes smaller than 1 meter
  every step we divide by another factor of 10
  10^-1 = 1/10, 10^-2 = 1/100, 10^-3 = 1/10^3 = 1/1000
  Draw about where they are on the diagram on your slides
  Human: 1.76 m
  greater than 1, less than 10
  Blue whale: 24.9 m
  between 10 and 100
  Frog: 7.7 mm
  Need to remember mm
  7.7 * 10^{-3} m
  Replace mm by 10^{-3} m
 Ratio 
  Write as fraction
  Divide leading factors
  Divide powers of 10
  Quotient rule
  What does it mean?
  How many frogs would you have to line up, snout to tail, to form a line as long as a blue whale?
  Two ways to form ratio.
  Other way
  How many pieces would you have to divide the whale into so that each piece is the size of a frog?
