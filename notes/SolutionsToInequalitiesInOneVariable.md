Two parts
  Part 1
    Goal: Make sense of solutions to inequalities. Recognize the pattern made by all solutions to an inequality. Student-facing: I can describe the set of numbers that make an inequality true.
    Assessment:
      1. Describe the pattern of the solution set to an inequality.
      2. Come up with one word that described the pattern.

  Part 2
    Goal: I can graph the solution set of an inequality by finding its boundaries and testing to see which sides are included.
    Assessment:
      

Notes:
  Introducing learning objective
  What is a set? Show off my set of dry-erase markers.
  It's all very nice with numbers, -3 has been to the left of -2 since I was your age, and probably before.
