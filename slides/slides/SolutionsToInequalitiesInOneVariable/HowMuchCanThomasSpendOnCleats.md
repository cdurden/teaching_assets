Thomas went to the store with \$100 to buy a new soccer ball and cleats. The soccer balls at the store costs \$19, and \$24, and \$30. 
<!--If he buys one of these balls, how much can Thomas spend on cleats?-->
<!--What matters is how much the cheapest soccer ball costs, because he will have the MOST money left for cleats if he buys the cheapest ball. He can spend any amount out of the remaining money.-->
