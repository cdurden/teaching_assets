Thomas went to the store with \$100 to buy a new soccer ball and cleats. The soccer ball he found was \$19. 
<!--Thomas sees a pair of cleats for $89 (including tax). Can he buy both a soccer ball and the cleats?-->
<!--What matters is how much the cheapest soccer ball costs, because he will have the MOST money left for cleats if he buys the cheapest ball. He can spend any amount out of the remaining money.-->
