After Thomas saw the soccer balls, he wrote an inequality on his notepad:
</p>
<div style="display: table; width=100%">
<div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; background-size: contain;background-position: center;background-repeat:  no-repeat;height: 400px; width: 400px; background-image: url(./images/Notepad.png);"><span><center>$$c+19 \le 100$$</center></span></div>
</div>
        <!--<img class="noborder" src="./images/Notepad.png">-->
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">

He said that $c$ represents the cost of a pair of cleats that he could buy.
</p>
<p class="md-font">
Then he went to find a pair of cleats.
