To help pay for his tuition, a college student plans to work in the evenings and on weekends. He has been offered two part-time jobs: working in the guest-services department at a hotel and waiting tables at a popular restaurant.

 * The job at the hotel pays $18 an hour and offers $33 in transportation allowance per month.
 * The job at the restaurant pays $7.50 an hour plus tips. The entire waitstaff typically collects about $50 in tips each hour. Tips are divided equally among the 4 waitstaff members who share a shift.
