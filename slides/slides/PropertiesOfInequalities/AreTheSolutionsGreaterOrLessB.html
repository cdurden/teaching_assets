<h4>Greater or less?</h4>

To solve the inequality $8-x < 10$, Anne first wrote the related equation $8-x = 10$. 

<div class="row md-font">
<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 4em;">
    What is the solution to the related equation?
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 4em;">
        Are the solutions to the original inequality greater than or less than the solutions to this equation? How do you know?
    </li>
</ol>
</div>
