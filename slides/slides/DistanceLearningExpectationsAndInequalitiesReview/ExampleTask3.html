Andre has a summer job selling magazine subscriptions. He earns $25 per week plus $3 for every subscription he sells. Andre hopes to make at least enough money this week to buy a new pair of soccer cleats.

The least expensive pair of cleats Andre wants costs $68. If Andre sold 16 magazine subscriptions this week, would he reach his goal?
