Diego was solving an equation, but when he checked his answer, he saw his solution was incorrect. He knows he made a mistake, but he can’t find it. Where is Diego’s mistake and what is the solution to the equation?

$\displaystyle \begin{align} \text-4(7-2x)=3(x+4)\\ \text-28-8x=3x+12\\ \text-28=11x+12\\ \text-40=11x\\ \text{-}\frac {40}{11}=x\ \end{align}$
