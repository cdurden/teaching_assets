You are walking along a beach and your toe hits something hard. You reach down, grab onto a handle, and pull out a lamp! It is sandy. You start to brush it off with your towel.

Poof! A genie appears.

* Purse A which contains \$1,000 today. If you leave it alone, it will contain \$1,200 tomorrow (by magic). The next day, it will have \$1,400. This pattern of \$200 additional dollars per day will continue.
* Purse B which contains 1 penny today. Leave that penny in there, because tomorrow it will (magically) turn into 2 pennies. The next day, there will be 4 pennies. The amount in the purse will continue to double each day.
