<h3>Communicate about your wellbeing</h3>
Like a lot of new experiences, there are likely to be parts of this distance learning experience that are stressful.

As teachers, we want to do what we can to keep our students happy, so please do not hesitate to communicate about <b>how you are doing</b>. We want to be aware of any unnessesary stress or difficulties that you may encounter, so that we can address them. Please reach out if you are struggling with anything!
