# Submitting Work

You can access the lesson and submit your work in two ways:

1. Work through the slides in Schoology, and click submit whenever you complete a task.
2. Open the Lesson Slides folder and download the lesson slides for the day as a PDF. Use Notability to open the slides and complete the tasks. Then submit your work back to the assignment in Schoology.
