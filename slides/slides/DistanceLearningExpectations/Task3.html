<h2>Task 3: Communicate with a classmate</h2>

<p class="md-font">
For this task, I am asking everyone to make an effort to <b>communicate with a classmate</b> who is in your same algebra class.
</p>

<h3>What should I say?</h3>
<p class="md-font">
The only requirement regarding content of your message is that it is school-appropriate and it involves an unknown number in some way. 
</p>

<h3>I need help contacting a classmate</h3>
<p class="md-font">
Here are some ideas for getting in touch with classmates:
<ol>
    <li>
        Post a message on the Schoology discussion board for this section.
    </li>
    <li>
        Draw, write, or type on the collaborative whiteboard here.
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
