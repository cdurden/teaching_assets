<h2>Task 3: Communicate with a classmate</h2>

For this task, I am asking everyone to make an effort to communicate with a classmate who is in your same algebra class. 

<h3>What should I say?</h3>
The only requirement regarding content of your message is that it is school-appropriate and it involves numbers. 

<h3>I need help contacting a classmate</h3>
Here are some ideas for getting in touch with classmates:

<ol>
    <li>
        Post a message on the Schoology discussion board for this section.
    </li>
    <li>
        Draw, write, or type on the collaborative whiteboard here.
    </li>
</ol>
