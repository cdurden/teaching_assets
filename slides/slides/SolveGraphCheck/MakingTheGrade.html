<h3>Making the grade</h3>

<div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    Jenna received a 70% on a math assignment. To get at least an 80% in math class, her grade on the next assignment must be a solution to the inequality:
    $$\frac{1}{2}(70+x) \ge 80$$
    On the next slide, you will help her find what grade she needs.
