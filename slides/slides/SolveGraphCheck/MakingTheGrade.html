<h3>Making the grade</h3>
<h4>Solving inequalities can help you set goals</h4>

<div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
    Jenna wants to know what grade she needs to get on an assignment in order to raise her grade to at least an 80% for the class. She received 70% on the first assignment, and she let $x$ stand for her grade on the second assignment. She said that her final grade would be the average of the two assignments, which is $\frac{70+x}{2}$, so she wrote the inequality $\frac{70+x}{2} \ge 80$.
