To solve the inequality $16-2x > 4$, Anne first wrote the related equation $16-2x = 4$. 

<div class="row md-font">
<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 4em;">
    For which $x$ is $16-2x=4$ true?
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        Which of the following inequalities describes the solutions to the original inequality?
    </li>
<div class="col-6 md-font">
    $$x>6$$
</div>
<div class="col-6 md-font">
    $$x<6$$
</div>
