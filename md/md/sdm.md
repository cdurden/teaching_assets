# Where does it live?

An ecologist is a scientist who studies how living things interact with each other and their environment. All types, or **species**, of living things require a specific kind of environment for survival. For example, we all need to live in a place that is not too hot or too cold. Some ecologists use mathematics to study where species can live. A mathematical representation of where a species can live is called a **species distribution model**.

Let's look at an example. The African forest elephant is one of the three living species of elephants. It lives in humid forests in African, and it is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a vulnerable species, which means it is likely to become endangered unless conditions change.

## Developing a model

The image above is called an **occurrence map**. It shows several locations where the African forest elephant has been observed. The map is a screenshot from the website inaturalist.org. Each point represents a location where this species elephant was observed by a contributor to that website's database.

We will use inequalities to describe where this species lives. We are going to draw a box using horizontal and vertical lines enclosing the points on the occurrence map.
