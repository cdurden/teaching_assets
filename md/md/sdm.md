# Where does it live?

**Learning goal**: I can use inequalities to describe where a species lives.

All types, or **species**, of living things require a specific kind of environment for survival. For example, we all need to live in a place that is not too hot or too cold. Some ecologists use mathematics to study where species can live. Let's look at an example. 

## African forest elephant

The African forest elephant is one of the three living species of elephants. It lives in humid forests in African, and conservation organizations classify it as a vulnerable species, which means it is likely to become endangered unless conditions change.

## Modeling where a species can live

The map below is called an **occurrence map**. Every red mark represents a location where the African forest elephant has been observed.

<b>Step 1</b>: Choose a species to investigate and use a biodiversity website to produce an occurrence map for your species.

## How to build our inequality model
<p>
<b>Step 2</b>: We draw a box using horizontal and vertical lines, enclosing all of the points on the occurrence map. The sides of the box are called **boundaries**.

<p>
<b>Step 3</b>: Using a map, we find the $x$ coordinates (longitude) of our left and right boundaries and the $y$ coordinates (latitude) of our top and bottom boundaries.
</p>

<p>
<b>Step 4</b>: We compare the coordinates of our boundaries to the coordinates inside the boundaries, and write inequalities to express our comparison.

## What is home like? 
The home, or **range**, of our species is represented by the region that we drew on the map. What is this environment like, and how is it different from regions where this species does not live? Answering this question could help us understand what this animal needs from its environment in order to survive.

Here are some maps that show some of the environmental conditions across the globe. Can you make a hypothesis about which factors are most important for the African forest elephant?
