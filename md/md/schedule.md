|==============|==================================|========================================================================================|=============|
| Monday, March 30   | [Solutions to Inequalities in One Variable] | I understand that the solution to an inequality is a range of values (such as x>7) that make the inequality true. | 
| Tuesday   | [Efficiently Solving Inequalities] | I can solve inequalities by solving a related equation and then checking which values are solutions to the original inequality. | |
| Wednesday   | Addition Property of Inequalities | I can solve inequalities using the addition property of inequalities. | |
| Thursday   | Multiplication Property of Inequalities | I can solve inequalities using the multiplication property of inequalities. | |
| Friday   | [Reasoning about Inequalities]     | I can solve one-variable inequalities and interpret the solutions in terms of the situation.

I can graph the solution to an inequality in one variable.
