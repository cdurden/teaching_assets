|================================================|========================================================================================|=============|
| **Monday, March 30**    [Distance Learning Expectations and Inequalities Review] | I understand how to fulfill the distance learning expectations for my Algebra class. | 
| **Tuesday, March 31**    [Solutions to Inequalities in One Variable] | I understand that the solution to an inequality is a range of values (such as x>7) that make the inequality true. | 
| **Wednesday, April 1**    [Efficiently Solving Inequalities] | I can solve inequalities by solving a related equation and then checking which values are solutions to the original inequality. | |
| **Thursday, April 2**    [Properties of Inequalities] | I can solve inequalities using the addition and multiplication properties of inequalities. | |
| **Friday, April 3**    [Reasoning about Inequalities]     | I can solve one-variable inequalities and interpret the solutions in terms of the situation.

I can graph the solution to an inequality in one variable.
