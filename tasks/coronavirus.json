{"disinfectant_wipes": {"title": "Disinfectant wipes", "task": "A linear model $y=mn+b$ can be used to estimate the amount of equipment a community has, where $n$ is the population, $m$ stands for the average amount of equipment per person, and $b$ stands for the amount that has been manufactured but is not yet distributed. To estimate the total, we might assume that people use equipment at a rate $k$ per day. Then about $\\frac{k}{m}$ people run out each day. If each person independently runs out of the equipment with probability $\\frac{k}{mn}$, then it is well known that the number of people who run out is binomially distributed with mean $\\frac{k}{m}$ and variance $n\\frac{k}{m}(1-\\frac{k}{m})$. Suppose a manufacturer makes equipment so that they will run out of equipment only one day every $10$ years. Find $b$ (You may assume that $n$ is large and use a normal approximation)."}}
