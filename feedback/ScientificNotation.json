There's one detail that I think you missed about scientific notation: When we write a number in scientific notation, remember that we move the decimal point until that we get a number <b>between 1 and 10</b>. That number between 1 and 10 becomes the factor (or leading factor) that we write in front of the power of ten. Look at your leading factors. Are they between $1$ and $10$? If not, your numbers are not in scientific notation. Can you change them so that they <i>are</i> in scientific notation?"
